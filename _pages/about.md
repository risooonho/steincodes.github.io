This the about page of the Steincodes website. But I am going to describe myself here.

Here I tell you all about myself.

I am a college student currently pursuing Bachelors in Computer Science.<br />
I love to do programming and it's become an integral part of my life.
Other than this I love to design things, and I don't mean cars but something at little less robust.<br />

I live in India. In the state of Uttar Pradesh<i>(meaning State-Of-The-North literally)</i> to be precise.<br />

I love to play video games in free time and probably that's all the wasteful information there is about me.

Currently, I make tutorials and have fun playing with different tools to learn more and more about programming and game development.
As for my age I am roughly 17.5 years old.<br />
I was born in 21st Century, Month November.
